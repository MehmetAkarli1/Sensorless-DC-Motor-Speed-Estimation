# Back EMF-Based Speed Estimation in a Brushed DC Motor Controller Using Low-Side Switching
# By Mehmet Akarli
# July 2025

This project demonstrates a sensorless method for estimating the speed of a brushed DC motor using Back EMF sampling. By briefly turning off the low-side MOSFET, the Back EMF generated by the motor is exposed and measured using the internal ADC of a PSoC microcontroller. The system calculates motor speed in real time and displays the result on an LCD.

## 📌 Features

- Back EMF-based RPM estimation without external sensors
- Low-side switching control using N-channel MOSFET
- Real-time voltage and speed display on LCD
- Current estimation using a sense resistor
- Oscilloscope validation with waveform analysis
- Built and tested using Cypress PSoC Creator
